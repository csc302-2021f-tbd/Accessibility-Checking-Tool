# 2021-10-28

We had this task split up from a few days ago:

1- Research a bit about which plugins we'll end up using (10 to 20) by Friday. 

2- Have tests that can be run using a single command
it'll run two plugins, the first would output a line if <head> or <body> is missing. The second would complain if some header is proceeded by a larger one in the html file, we could skip the second for now though. Ahmad

3- Split up the plugin implementation and the remaining tasks on us, write that in A2.  Ben/All of us

4- find a way to install all dependencies through one command 
But it can't be a script that uses sudo, and it can't be a script that just install npm/whatever onto someone's machine.
If someone can find a way to make a virtual environment, we want that. idk how a docker image is related to this, but this is the thread I have on this right now.

5- make a .sh script to replace the .py that launches the program. We could use a node script instead... I think.

Ben is taking care of 1. 
  
Ahmad will take care of writing the two plugins (subpart of 2).
  
Ben and all of us will split up the tasks (3).
  
Hao will take care of 4.
  
Whoever has time will do 5.
  
Ahmad will do whatever cleanup needed for the readme, and the notes Greg had on our existing stuff.
