Talked about our next steps. Roughly we should start working in a day or two on making the engine that loads plugins, or at least attempt that.
We're going to email Greg about acceptance tests by the weekend at the latest. We might also have a meeting with Greg soon to talk about our progress. 
Once we have some stuff to share we'll email him about the meeting he suggested/asked for last time.
