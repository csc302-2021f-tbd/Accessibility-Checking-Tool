- This meeting was the first hour of the lecture. This hour was shared amongst all projects Greg is supervising. 
- We talked about acceptance tests, and it's basically a binding contract between the devs and the customer.
- A customer usually doesn't have a clear idea of the specifics of what he wants, and it's our role to force them to think about it in the detail required.
- For our project, we'd want the tool to work on pages, where we get some URLs to bad pages, manually save them, and run checks on them, generating the report.
- A customer could give us a page, and what he's expecting our tool to do, and if our tool does it, then we passed the test.
- In our case, I think we'll make some pages ourselves, mark out some problems in them and that our acceptance test would be pointing them out, present it as a suggestion to Greg, the customer in this case. If he thinks this is a good acceptance test, he'll agree and "sign the contract".
- This depends a bit on whether the test should be made at the deadline of A2 or for our final project. Depending on what this is, we'll think of the specifics of the test (the level of checks going to made basically), and talk with Greg.
- I'm going to ask the professor about this still.
