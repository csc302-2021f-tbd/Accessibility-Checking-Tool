## TA Meeting 

- Meeting notes should contain options discussed, which one we picked, why we picked it.
- Setup a reasonable timeframe for project members to respond. If someone was late, they get skipped in the decision-making process.
- Have to meet weekly and start working on the project, regardless of logistics. 
- Brought up what's required for A2.
