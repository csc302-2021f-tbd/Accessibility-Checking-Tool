# Postmortem of A2

## Achieved Goals

 Milestones 1 and 2.

## Missed Goals, And By How Much

 We readjusted our goals midway between A1 and A2, after talking with professors Mike and Greg. After the adjustments, we reached our first and second milestones. So we did miss some of our initial goals, but we delivered our new ones. We readjusted our milestones because we're now one member short.

## Adjustments

 We readjusted our milestones themselves, and removed the parts where we deploy our JS program. Now it is only accessed via node.js through a terminal, and we won't attempt anything more in regards of deployment.
