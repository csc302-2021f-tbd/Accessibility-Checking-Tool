# Postmortem of A2

## Achieved Goals

We completed the majority of our main goals for A2: a breakdown of each planned accessibility violation with acceptance criteria, implementations of the engine and two basic plugins, tests for the two plugins, and then ensuring that our program could be installed in one step. We first were successful working together to determine which accesibility errors we could check for and the acceptance criteria for such checks. We then decided what should be implemented for A2, divided the work up, and followed through on this.

## Missed Goals, And By How Much

There were two main areas in which our A2 fell short. The first was the level of detail in our postmortem of A1. It was very brief and didn't thoroughly analyze the areas in which we succeeded and fell short. The second shortcoming of A2 was that we didn't have any details as to how we were going to split tasks. Our to-do stated that we would do a roughly equal amount of work but was quite vague and not quite all-encompassing. Both of these stemmed from a failure to assign the non-coding tasks to team members and poor communication about the submission of the assignment in general.

## Adjustments

Our adjustment is that we have to communicate more consistently about our progress on A3 tasks, as well as assign non-coding tasks and ensure that they are completed.
Our communication though, is probably the biggest area in which we need to improve. We failed to meet consistently and our meetings lacked both structure and focus. We were challenged as a group to see consistency between some of the communication within meetings and progress outside of meetings, and we will need to be more specific about task assignments and more strategic with the assginments themselves so that differences in when we allocate time to this project individually don't cause issues completing tasks.
