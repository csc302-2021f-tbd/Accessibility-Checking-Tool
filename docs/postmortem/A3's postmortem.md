# Postmortem of A3

## Achieved Goals

We completed the majority of our main goals for A2: a breakdown of each planned accessibility violation with acceptance criteria, implementations of the engine and one basic plugins, tests for the plugins, and then ensuring that our program could be installed in one step. We first were successful working together to determine which accessibility errors we could check for and the acceptance criteria for such checks. We then decided what should be implemented for A2, divided the work up, and followed through on this.
We've achieved most of milestone 3, most of the acceptance tests for A3. 

## Missed Goals, And By How Much

There were two main areas in which our A2 fell short. The first was the level of detail in our postmortem of A1. It was very brief and didn't thoroughly analyze the areas in which we succeeded and fell short. The second shortcoming of A2 was that we didn't have any details as to how we were going to split tasks. Our to-do stated that we would do a roughly equal amount of work but was quite vague and not quite all-encompassing. Both of these stemmed from a failure to assign the non-coding tasks to team members and poor communication about the submission of the assignment in general.
We've missed some of our plugins listed in A3. We skipped plugin 5 which detects redundant links. Since we would have to use a good criteria for detecting how close two links are to be redundant, which might be hard to detect using a plain HTML, but easy to judge when looking on the page generated from it.
We've also missed milestone 4 completely. Initially we should have implemented a way in our engine to detect if one of the plugins supplied was actually valid. This was the forth goal and we haven't delivered on 3 completely, so we skipped milestone 4 due to prioritizing. Our acceptance criteria is completely around milestone 3 goals, so it took a higher priority.
We've also skipped processing inernal and external CSS rules. We didn't have time to experiment with how to correctly get the rules corresponding to elements, so we didn't want to allocate time to implementing something that might end up being broken or incomplete.

## Adjustments

Our adjustment is that we have to communicate more consistently about our progress on A3 tasks, as well as assign non-coding tasks and ensure that they are completed.
Our communication though, is probably the biggest area in which we need to improve. We failed to meet consistently, and our meetings lacked both structure and focus. We were challenged as a group to see consistency between some of the communication within meetings and progress outside of meetings, and we will need to be more specific about task assignments and more strategic with the assignments themselves so that differences in when we allocate time to this project individually don't cause issues completing tasks.
Our adjustments included dropping some plugins including number 5, solely because of time constraints. We've pushed the more complex plugins to the end to cover more ground first. And didn't have time to wrap everything up. We've also laid out the goals with more members in mind, but ended up with half the members at the end. This is especially true regarding our forth milestone, which we didn't have time to consider at all.
