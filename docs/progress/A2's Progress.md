# Industry Partner Definition of Success For Each Milestone

Our industry partner is professor Greg. We've been emailing him about our progress, he's approved of our initial achievement of milestone 1, creating the engine that loads the plugins. We've also created one basic plugin that checks if either the <head> or <body> elements are missing or empty in an HTML page, which constitutes our milestone 2.

# Members Responsibilities For Reaching Our Milestones

  For milestone 1, Ben reaserched the accessibility violations we'll be checking in our plugins, which makes up this list: [`docs/tasks/A2s TODOs`](https://github.com/csc302-2021f-tbd/Accessibility-Checking-Tool/blob/main/docs/tasks/A2s%20TODOs.md) and Ahmad has mostly wrote the code of the engine and the functioality of loading plugins.
  Milestone 2 was a simple JS function that Ahmad wrote.
  
# Validation Progress

  Mostly ad-hoc testing, and emails with Greg as well.
