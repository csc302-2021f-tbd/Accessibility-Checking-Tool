# Accessibility-Checking-Tool
A tool that detects various accessibility violations in web pages.

## Tech Stack
- We'll be using jsdom and JavaScript because...
- We won't be using ... because ...

### Milestones

- We'll create an engine that is responsible for running different plugins, each of which are responsible for identfying a specific accessibility check violation, applies these checks on the DOM tree, and generate error reports.
- Create a basic set of plugins that run simple accessibility checks.
- Build a command-line program that takes an HTML file, runs a chosen set of tests on it.
- Create a web app or extension that takes a URL input, downloads the HTML file, runs the checks server side, then finally produces a set of results back to the user.
- Keep increasing our set of plugins during milestones 3-4.

### Responsibilities

- Kevin Lu: 
- Ben Grass:
- Ahmad Rehan: Mostly work on individual plugins, with some contribution to the other webdev aspects, albeit smaller than the others. Should contribute to everything in general, but might focus more on isolated tasks that require less webdev knowledge.
